ods text="Every single year human lives, ecosystems and properties are at risk due to wildfires in the state of North-Carolina (NC).
 Wildfires harm both air and water quality while efforts to fight wildfires are expensive and put emergency personel in harms way.
 A better understanding of the dynamics behind destructive wildfires can aid prevention efforts. This report analyses the causes,
 timings and sizes of wildfires accross different counties in NC. The data is obtained from the United States Forest Service (USFS)
 and spans accross 1992 to 2015.\n\n
 The analyses in this report have been performed on a dataset containing the following categorical
 variables: the county the fire occured in, it's fips code, the year and month the fire was
 discovered in, the official cause with a matching cause code and the fire size binned into seven categories. The continuous variables 
 studied are the discovery date of the fire, the fire size and the coordinates of the fire. The only missing values in the dataset are
 for the variables county and the fips code. The county variable also contained several erroneousness entrees, all of which were correctable. Below the
 first 5 rows of the dataset are depicted as an example.\n\n";
